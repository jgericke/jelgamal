/** @file
    Interface for BigDigits "bd" random number functions using a "pretty-good" internal RNG

@par The internal random number generator (RNG)
The internal RNG uses a variant of the random number generation algorithm 
in Appendix A of ANSI X9.31-1998, but using the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEAX)
instead of the Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA). 
It uses the current time and process ID as a seed. 
Although not strictly crypto secure, it is "pretty good", and certainly much better than
anything using the built-in rand() function in C. Look at the source code and make your own call.

@par 
If you want proper cryptographic security, use the bdRandomSeeded() function with a call to a
secure RNG function that you trust.
